This repository contains the data used for interpretability analyses of COVID-19 case predictions in New York City (NYC) and the United Kingdom (UK).  
The data were employed to compare models with and without variant information, demonstrating that including variants substantially improves forecasting performance and should be considered in COVID-19 predictive modeling.
